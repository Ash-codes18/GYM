            As Strength Section is one of the Shortest and hardest part in the Workout Routine, it has been
            subdivided into three parts.
            Strength training is one of the most rigorous training workouts that you can experience.
            All the work that you put forth during a body building workout benefits you in several different ways.
            By performing body building exercises just a few days each week you can increase your stamina and
            metabolism, and build lean, strong muscles.
            Greg begins a weight training regimen and is focusing on strength gain.
            His regimen calls for high intensity lifts at slow rates of movement.
            He completes 3-5 sets of each exercise. Greg sees rapid strength improvements over the first four weeks
            which show in weeks 5-8.
            Strength training or resistance training is a type of exercise referred to as low frequency high force
            output activity. Physical activities includes lifting free weights and using resistance machines.

            BENCH PRESS :

                A bench press is an exercise that can be used to strengthen the muscles of the upper body, including the
                pectorals, arms, and shoulders.<br>

                Depending on your goals, there are different variations of bench presses that work slightly different
                muscles, too. For example, a narrower grip bench press will put extra emphasis on the triceps and
                forearms.<br>

                Other benefits of adding bench presses to your weight-training regimen include increasing upper body
                strength, improving muscular endurance, and even preparing your upper body to do movements like pushups.
                They also can be an effective strengthening exercise for sports like sprinting, hockey, and football.
                <br>
                Muscles worked by a bench press
                Bench presses work several different muscles in your upper body, including the chest, shoulders, and
                arms.
                <br>
                Although the muscles worked may vary slightly depending on the specific variation that you perform,
                bench presses can target the following muscles:
                <br>
                1.) pectoralis major
                2.) anterior deltoid
                3.) triceps brachii
                4.) biceps brachii
                5.) serratus anterior

                The deadlift is a weight training exercise in which a loaded barbell or bar is lifted off the ground
                to the level of the hips, torso perpendicular to the floor, before being placed back on the ground.
                It is one of the three powerlifting exercises, along with the squat and bench press.
                <br><br>
                Deadlift phases :
                Phase 1
                Phase 2
                Phase 3
                <br><br>
                Two styles of deadlift are commonly used in competition settings: the sumo deadlift and the
                conventional (or standard) deadlift. While both of these styles are permitted under the rules of
                powerlifting competition, only the conventional stance is used in strongman deadlifting contests
                Once you've mastered the hip hinge, you're ready to work toward the main event.

                A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position
                and then stands back up. During the descent of a squat, the hip and knee joints flex while the
                ankle joint dorsiflexes; conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint
                plantarflexes when standing up.

                Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the lower body
                muscles as well as developing core strength. The primary agonist muscles used during the squat
                are the quadriceps femoris, the adductor magnus, and the gluteus maximus.The squat also
                isometrically uses the erector spinae and the abdominal muscles, among others.

                The squat is one of the three lifts in the strength sport of powerlifting, together with the
                deadlift and the bench press. It is also considered a staple exercise in many popular
                recreational exercise programs. he squat begins from a standing position. Weight is often added
                and is typically in the form of a loaded barbell. Dumbbells and kettlebells may also be used.
